    know what to and what not to do on given entity. Note that to develop this system database there are some
     material which were used so that we can get on final output of system as was described in in your system 
     analysis of how your system can work. </P>

     <h2>2. JAVA PROGRAMMING</h2>
     <H3>2 .1 introduction </H3>
     <P>In this chapter I will be describing how powerful general purpose programming language was used to create 
        the analyzed system. Under this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function 
        together with database that have been describe above and how it cope with full analyzed system.</P>
        <H3>2.2 Tools used to develop this system in java programming:</H3>
        <P> Eclipse IDE: an integrated development environment used in computer programming. 
            It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. 
            It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and, until 2016, was the most popular. </P>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for 
                aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, 
                the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>2.3 Forms description </h3>
                <p>So let look together how the system will function one by one from the beginning up to the end.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>1.	Login form</h4>
                <p>For a Clinic Management System implemented in Java, the login functionality typically involves creating 
                    a user interface for users to enter their credentials (email and password) and click on Login Button to 
                    confirm your credentials according to your information you have been assigned in ACCOUNT TABLE in database. 
                    If you have to create account you can go on create new account button in order to create new account
                    </p>
                    <img src="login.jpg" alt="">
                    <h4>2. Account Form</h4>
                    <p>To create a new account you typically need to implement functionality to collect user information, validate input, and then store the information Account table in the database. 
	
                        Create new account method to inserts the user information into the database. You would need to implement methods for getting user input, validating input.
                        </p>

                        <h4>3.Clinic management system Menu Form</h4>
                        <p>Creating a menu form for a clinic management system involves designing a user interface (UI) that allows users to navigate through different functionalities of the system.
                            Such as home, patient, doctor, nurse, clinic, appointment, service:
                            If you want to go on patient form you can click on patient, all form you want to go you may have to click on it.
                            </p>
